This directory contains scripts to estimate a 1981-2010 climatology for 20CRV3.

This would be easy if 20CRV3 had output for 1981-2010, but we don't yet have this - but we do have output for 2916-1919. So we need to estimate the climatology by applying a correction to the 20CRV2c climatology over 1981-2010. The correction appplied is the difference between V3 and V2c over 1916-1919 (where we have data for both).

So the algorithm is:

1) Get climatology for 20CRv2c for 1981-2010.
2) Make climatology for 20CRv2c for 1916-1918.
3) Make climatology for 20CRV3 for 1916-1919

4) Calculate 3)-2)+1) on the V3 grid - this is the climatology estimate.

1) Can be downloaded as part of the 20CR dataset.

2) and 3) can be calculated using functions in the GSDF.TWCR R package (after downloading the data. ('TWCR.make.climatology').

The scripts in this package make 4). They save it as the climatology for version 4.0.0 - to make it easilly available to other analysis scripts.
